# Handwritten Digit Recognizer
This is a warm-up project for validating neural network knowledge. This model can indentify decimal digits from 0-9.
- Here, Dense type layer is used.
- Sigmoid function is used as activation function.
- Observed accuracy through confusion matrix.
- Only one hidden layer is added.  

**Dataset:** MNIST Dataset.  

**Tools:** NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Keras. 

### Performance Evaluation:
- **Without Hidden Layer:** Almost 92% accuracy.
- **With One Hiddden Layer:** Almost 97% accurate.
